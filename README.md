# mlbankproject

I have created a machine learning algorithm to help banks decide whether or not to approve a business loan based on cash flow only. Due to sensitive nature of bank statements, these type of data sets were not accessible online so instead I synthetically created data and trained my model on four classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification(SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors, and RandomForest Classification. I was able to achieve 90% accuracy or greater on each model. I have attached additional findings on the "Visuals" Section of this project. Enjoy
